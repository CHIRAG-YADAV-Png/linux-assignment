# Linux Shell Assignment

## Project Overview  
This repository contains a set of shell-scripts written in Bash to perform common system-administration tasks. The goal is to build simple, reusable tools for backup, monitoring, and automated downloads. Each script is standalone and can be executed directly from the command line.

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- A Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, WSL) with Bash installed.  
- Basic permissions to run/execute shell scripts (`chmod +x`).  
- If needed, sudo privileges (depending on what the script does).





Below is a brief overview of each script in this repository:

backup.sh

Performs a backup of specified files or directories. Configuration may include the source path(s), target backup location, and optional compression or timestamping. Useful for routine backups of data.

monitor.sh

Monitors system resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, disk) or other parameters and logs / alerts if thresholds are exceeded. Can be used to keep an eye on system health over time.

download.sh

Automates downloading of files from a given URL (or list of URLs). May include features like retry, logging, and organizing downloaded files into folders.
